Resistance Calculator written in Python 3
===================================

This script was used to determine the five resistor values that are on the product. 
I decided to include the script in the case that the user wants to add a sixth
resistor value. 99 percent of the time the user will only want the one fixed time
that the resistor sets, but in if you're curious to see what combination of
resistances/times are possible with the added resistor then all you need is
this scrips. Add the complete value to the resistor array in the script and
uncomment the lines that state "Uncomment...". You'll have to look at the chart
in the datasheet to see how the values translate into time.
